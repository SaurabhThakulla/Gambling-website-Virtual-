This project is a frontend-only prototype of an online gaming and betting platform.
It focuses on designing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface without any backend or real-money functionality.

The project includes pages like home, game listings, wallet UI, user profile, and basic navigation flows.
Built purely for UI/UX practice, layout structuring, and frontend skill enhancement.
